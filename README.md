# Dog Breed Classification (PyTorch)

This is the udacity project on dog breed classification

The project has been executed in an AWS  sagemaker instance using CUDS GPU and Pytorch framework as the principal components

The project has been completed using the .ipynb file in the dog breed classification project in Udacity's Github repository.

## Project Steps

The following steps has been followed to execure the project

Step 0: Import Datasets
Step 1: Detect Humans
Step 2: Detect Dog
Step 3: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (from Scratch)
Step 4: Create a CNN to Classify Dog Breeds (using Transfer Learning)
Step 5: Write the Algorithm
Step 6: Test the Algorithm
